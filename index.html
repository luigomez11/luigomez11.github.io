                Hello! My name is Luis. I am a fullstack developer in the Greater New York area.

            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>
                I am a web developer and recent graduate of the FullStack Development program at Thinkful. I believe coding is a skill that everyone should know and it has grown into one of my favorite things to learn about.  Before Thinkful, I graduated with a degree in chemical engineering, so problem solving has always been a strength for me and that lines up perfectly with my coding.  In my spare time I play and watch a lot of sports.  One of my favorite hobbies is that I co-host a sports podcast, which can be found at wttspod.com.  Along with sports, I also play videogames, listen to music and (attempt) to play instruments, and I watch a lot of movies.
