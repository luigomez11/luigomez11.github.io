            <p class="description">
                I am a web developer and recent graduate of the FullStack Development program at Thinkful. I believe coding is a skill that everyone should know and it has grown into one of my favorite things to learn about.  Before Thinkful, I graduated with a degree in chemical engineering, so problem solving has always been a strength for me and that lines up perfectly with my coding.  In my spare time I play and watch a lot of sports.  One of my favorite hobbies is that I co-host a sports podcast, which can be found at wttspod.com.  Along with sports, I also play videogames, listen to music and (attempt) to play instruments, and I watch a lot of movies.

                <p class="storyDesc">StoryTime is a fullstack online short stories app.  The main purpose of the app is to give users a story to read while they have time to spare.  In other words, if you find yourself needing to kill some time (or procrastinating), this is a great app for you.  All stories are user submitted and completely anonymous! If youâ€™d like to get something off your chest but remain a secret, then submit your own story and be done with it.</p>
